#In this assessment, two maps are generated by R and Arcgis. By comparing, these two maps have their own benefits and drawbacks. In terms of software, predominantly code-based software such as R or MapBox can add data online, open source and free. However, some errors are frequently happening in R, and R is more time-consuming than GIS software. GUI-based piece of GIS Software may more accessible for people who do not have programming skill as people can easily change map elements by simply using the toolbar buttons. However in R studio people must programming more code to achieve more functions . In terms of generated maps, people can insert any items such as legend on maps wherever they wanted, however, in R people should write code to place those items. There are many color options for people to choose in Arcgis. People can change the data pause for each class in Arcgis. Besides, in Arcgis people can label the area name by toolbar easily. The layers of Arcgis are convenient, people can simply choose which layer they want to present in the map. However R cannot achieve this function. In R people can create interactive maps, however Arcgis do not have this function.

#The data used in the generation are from the London datastore. The data is about average housing price in the London borough and contain quarterly, median and mean house prices, lower quartile prices and sales volumes. In this process I use the year ending December 2017 column in the mean sheet to present average housing price in London. The measure of data is GBP.

#In R studio, install function and library function are important. People should make sure they have already installed and called the package; otherwise the program running process may be wrong. In addition, R studio requires patience because the running process is slow. In Arcgis software, people should make sure the import data format.
